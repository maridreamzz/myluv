    <p class="letter-p">Yes, this was the secret... I suppose it isn't as great as I made it sound but at the same time, after not doing any coding and JUST learning JavaScript, I'm somewhat a little proud of it. <br><br> I have a few things to say. I think... Just a few. Granted, I'm writing this before I write everything else since I wanted at least a little bit of order when I was writing. I love writing already. You know that. But I have so much to say and only so much time to say it.<br><br>I love you so much. I hope this at least makes you a little happy, my love.</p>

    <p class="letter-p">When I first met you, I thought you were sweet. I really did. I liked the way you talked, weirdly, and I liked the way you acted. I preferred to be around people who had some joking manner but also knew when boundaries were crossed. I know when I met you, it wasn't as easy. I know when I met you, and as I got to learn more, that I was able to help you with communicating.<br><br>Everything I thought of you when we first met, through my first impressions of you, I thought with some care. I was with my ex when we met and so I never crossed boundaries. I know we had our little... fun. But I also think that it made my brain almost trust you more in a weird way. I almost want to thank you, but mostly because if it didn't happen, I don't know what could have. I couldn't imagine having you right now any other way.<br><br>I fell in love with how you looked too. When you went to Katey's house and turned on the camera, I'll be entirely honest. I thought you were hot. I didn't even care what you wore or the fact that you looked like a stereotypical mexican. I thought you were one of the most handsome peopel that I had ever gotte to look at. At that time, I thought it would be like a me-and-Jude thing, where I like you a bit, tell you, then it gets joked about for the months upcoming.</p>

    <p class="letter-p">I have a few favorite moments. I have a few in mind. Playing games with you is the most fun I've had. I loved when I was obsessed with Fortnite, even when I dropped it when the new season sucked. I loved when we played Doors on Roblox with your friends, especially when you threw that little bomb and I heard the Hallelujah music and thought it was some special item and then we both died. I'll be honest, I laughed really hard. I've laughed a lot with you and your friends more genuinely than I have in months.<br><br>When it comes to moments alone, I know there's hard ones. I still like those. I like that I can be remidned that communicating with you can be easy if I just keep communicating and breathe. Nothing gets solved in anger. Every time we've had an argument or a conversation with you with some epitome of anger, I get anxious. But what helps is that I know you do too. I know that I can talk us both down if I need to.<br><br>But other moments alone... Lord, I love them. I love being able to cry in my car and here you tell me about how you could read every book in a library and still not have enough words to describe me. No one's said that to me. No one's even said anything remotely like that to me. I loved when we had our cameras on that one night and you'd stare at me with this look. You looked at me and would keep looking till I noticed. It was pure silence. You watched me the entire time and then told me how pretty I was and how beautiful I was. I blushed every time and you made me feel not only fully appreciated but loved.</p>

    <p class="letter-p">The simple answer: everything.<br><br>The complicated answer: everything.<br><br>I love the way that when you smile, you look away a little bit. You try to hide it sometimes. When you do, it twitches a little, like when I said to "look at my pretty boy" and I showed a picture of my dog. You snapped your head so fast, and you tried to suppress your smile. Your little mouth twitches when you try to suppress it is adorable.<br><br>I love the way that you treat me in such a sweet way. The way your voice fluctuates the slightest when you talk to me versus other people drives me nuts. You say "hiii" every time we join a voice call with just us, and I love it. It's the sweetest thing and makes me feel warm... Is it weird to compare it to drinking warm milk? That's what it feels like.<br><br>I love the way that when we talk, I don't have to hide. I hope you don't. I'm too open about everything and anything to feel anxious talking. Even when I'm communicating, though there's that small bit of anxiety digging into me, I still feel that I can talk about anything.<br><br>I love the way I can see the way you perservere for the things you want and it makes me want to perservere too. You always make a point to talk to me at the very least. At the most, you put in effort to do it. It's motivating to do better myself. I know everything you do is going to come to you, but you gotta keep trying. You already are.<br><br>I love the way you've been there for me. Even if you don't know exactly how to comfort me, you've still been there and you've still tried to, at the very least, provide your comfort when you didn't know anything else.<br><br>I love you and everything about you, and when I say that, I love everything.</p>

    <p class="letter-p">We've talked about it before. I think I want to keep talking about it.<br><br>I know when I get up there that life isn't going to be easy. Don't lose sight of the future, though. It'll be hard but after we're done, we'll do what we wanted to do.<br><br>We can move to our Seattle apartment with a view and enjoy my homemade meals and have freedom in luxury when we can finally afford it.<br><br>We can do our van life, building and modifying it until we're satisfied. We can travel around the United States and lord knows, maybe Canada and Mexico. We can get comfortable and explore and learn more about us as people and about us as a couple.<br><br>We can find land and we can design our own house, build our own house, live in our own house. You can work remotely and go into the city for your occasional work. I can homestead and work on us being more self sufficient with chickens and rabbits and quail and maybe a few cows. I can grow us a garden and learn how to preserve foods for us. We can have enough land to ethically hunt on it without causing any harm to the local wildlife. I can practice falconry and have a giant weathering yard and mews for my birds. Maybe I can even start a breeding program with them and make more efficient hunters and healthy birds... We can settle down and enjoy our lives. I haven't thought further for the life of me.<br><br>We can do everything we want, and I'll do what I can to make sure we get there.</p>
